# CTS-Unet-Urban-Change-Detection
It is the implementation of the paper: Urban change detection by convolutional Siamese concatenate network with Swin transformer.
Here, we provide the Tensorflow implementation of the convolutional Siamese concatenate network with Swin transformer (CTS_Unet) for remote sensing image change detection.
